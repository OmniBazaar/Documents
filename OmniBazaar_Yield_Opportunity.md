# OmniBazaar Yield Opportunity

## Your Gateway to High-Yield DeFi Returns

---

## Executive Summary

**Are you ready to participate in one of the most compelling liquidity opportunities in DeFi?**

OmniBazaar is launching a multi-phase liquidity program offering **45-180% projected APY** across three proven mechanisms. With a 2.5 billion XOM treasury reserve backing the program and a self-funding model that generates returns for both investors and the protocol, this is an opportunity designed for sophisticated investors who understand the power of early participation.

**Why This Opportunity Stands Out:**
- **Exceptional Yields:** 45-180% APY across multiple strategies
- **Early Mover Advantage:** LBP participants acquire XOM at discovery prices before public trading
- **Multiple Entry Points:** Choose LBP, Bonding, or Mining based on your risk preference
- **Strong Treasury Backing:** 2.5 billion XOM reserve ensures program sustainability
- **Self-Funding Model:** Your participation generates protocol liquidity AND your returns
- **Platform:** Avalanche Subnet with 1-2 second finality and minimal fees

- **Validator Network:** Decentralized computation with on-chain accountability
- **Consensus:** Avalanche Snowman with 1-2 second finality
- **Throughput:** 4,500+ TPS for seamless operations

### 1.3 Token Economics: Built for Value

**XOM Token Metrics:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Supply | 16.6 billion XOM |
| Permanently Burned | 8.4 billion XOM (never returning) |
| Current Circulating | 4.13 billion XOM |
| Treasury LP Reserve | 2.5 billion XOM |
| Current Price | $0.005 |
| Fully Diluted Valuation | $83 million |

**Why This Matters to You:**
- **Fixed Supply:** 8.4 billion tokens permanently burned—no surprise dilution
- **Treasury Backing:** 2.5 billion XOM dedicated to YOUR liquidity rewards
- **Low Entry Point:** $0.005 current price offers significant upside potential
- **Deflationary Pressure:** Fee burns and staking reduce circulating supply over time

**Staking Returns (Additional Earning Opportunity):**

| Tier | Amount Staked | Base APR | With Duration Bonus |
|------|---------------|----------|---------------------|
| 1 | 1 - 999,999 XOM | 5% | Up to 8% |
| 2 | 1M - 9.99M XOM | 6% | Up to 9% |
| 3 | 10M - 99.99M XOM | 7% | Up to 10% |
| 4 | 100M - 999.99M XOM | 8% | Up to 11% |
| 5 | 1B+ XOM | 9% | Up to 12% |

**Stack your returns:** Earn LP rewards + staking APR for maximum yield.

## Part 2: Your Investment Options

Three proven mechanisms, each designed to reward early participants like you.

### 2.1 Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP) — *Best for Price Discovery*

**What You Get:**
The LBP offers you the chance to acquire XOM through a fair Dutch auction mechanism. The price starts high and gradually decreases, allowing you to enter at your target price point. Patient participants who time their entry well can capture significant value.

**How It Works (Dutch Auction):**

| Phase | XOM Weight | Price Effect | Your Strategy |
|-------|------------|--------------|---------------|
| Start | 90% | Highest prices | Wait and watch |
| Middle | 60% | Declining prices | Monitor for entry |
| End | 30% | Lowest base prices | Sweet spot if demand is low |

**The Dutch Auction Math:**
- Pool starts heavily weighted toward XOM (90%), which *inflates* the XOM price
- As weights shift toward USDC (70%), the price multiplier drops from 9x to 0.43x
- Price naturally declines over 72 hours—this discourages front-running bots
- When price hits YOUR fair value target, that's your entry signal
- 0.3% swap fees accrue to LP holders throughout

**Technical Parameters:**

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Duration | 72 hours |
| Starting XOM Weight | 90% (high price) |
| Ending XOM Weight | 30% (lower base price) |
| Swap Fee | 0.3% (yours to earn) |
| Price Floor | Configured minimum to protect value |

**Why Dutch Auction Benefits YOU:**
- **No Front-Running:** Bots can't exploit early blocks—price starts too high
- **Fair Discovery:** Price finds natural equilibrium through market demand
- **Your Control:** YOU decide when the price is right for your entry
- **Buy Pressure Indicator:** When others start buying, it signals market consensus

**Historical Performance:**
Top LBP launches have delivered exceptional returns for well-timed participants:

| Project | Amount Raised | Returns for Timed Entries |
|---------|---------------|---------------------------|
| Copper Launch (avg) | $2-15M | 50-200%+ |
| Balancer LBPs | $5-50M | Varies by entry timing |
| Gitcoin (GTC) | $50M+ | 200%+ for mid-LBP entrants |

**Your Projected Returns:** 80-150% APY (based on historical benchmarks)

**Risk Level:** Medium — Dutch auction rewards patience, but don't wait too long.

### 2.2 Protocol-Owned Liquidity (Bonding) — *Best for Guaranteed Discounts*

**What You Get:**
Purchase XOM at a **5-15% discount** to market price. Your tokens vest over 7-30 days, then they're yours to hold, stake, or trade.

**Why Bonding Works for You:**
- **Guaranteed Discount:** Lock in 5-15% below market price
- **Short Vesting:** 7-30 days—not months or years
- **No Impermanent Loss:** Unlike LP positions, your discount is locked in
- **Compound Opportunity:** Bond, vest, bond again for continuous returns

**Your Returns:**

| Your Discount | Vesting Period | Your Annualized Return |
|---------------|----------------|------------------------|
| 5% | 7 days | **260% APY** |
| 10% | 14 days | **260% APY** |
| 15% | 30 days | **182% APY** |

**Example — Your $10,000 Bond:**
1. You deposit $10,000 in USDC or LP tokens
2. At 5% discount, you receive $10,500 worth of XOM
3. Tokens vest linearly over 7 days
4. Day 7: You own $10,500 in XOM (assuming flat price)
5. If XOM rises 20% during vesting: You own $12,600

**Technical Parameters:**

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Discount Range | 5% - 15% |
| Vesting Period | 7 - 30 days |
| Accepted Assets | USDC, LP tokens, approved RWAs |
| Daily Capacity | Limited—first come, first served |

**Historical Validation:**
Bonding mechanisms have created billions in value:

| Protocol | Peak TVL | Investor Returns |
|----------|----------|------------------|
| Olympus DAO | $4B | 5-15% discounts |
| Redacted Cartel | $500M | 7-12% discounts |

**Risk Level:** Low-Medium — Discount is guaranteed; only risk is price movement during vesting.

### 2.3 Liquidity Mining (LP Staking) — *Best for Passive Income*

**What You Get:**
Stake your LP tokens and earn continuous XOM rewards. This is DeFi's proven passive income strategy, enhanced with vesting to align long-term interests.

**Your Reward Structure:**
- **30% Immediate:** Claim and compound right away
- **70% Vested:** Releases over 90 days for sustained income

**Your Returns Based on Pool Size:**

| If Total Pool TVL Is | Your Daily Share (per $10K) | Your APY |
|----------------------|----------------------------|----------|
| $100,000 | $5.00/day | **182.5%** |
| $250,000 | $2.00/day | **73%** |
| $500,000 | $1.00/day | **36.5%** |
| $1,000,000 | $0.50/day | **18.25%** |

**Early Staker Advantage:** Lower TVL = Higher APY. First movers earn the highest returns.

**Enhanced Mainnet Projections:**

| Pool TVL | Daily Rewards | At $0.01 XOM | Your APY |
|----------|---------------|--------------|----------|
| $500,000 | 50,000 XOM | $500/day | **365%** |
| $1,000,000 | 50,000 XOM | $500/day | **182.5%** |
| $2,500,000 | 50,000 XOM | $500/day | **73%** |

**Compounding Strategy:**
1. Stake LP tokens → Earn rewards
2. Claim 30% immediate rewards
3. Use rewards to acquire more LP tokens
4. Stake additional LP tokens
5. Repeat for exponential growth

**Risk Level:** Medium — Impermanent loss possible, but high APY typically compensates.

## Part 3: Launch Timeline — When to Enter

### Phase 1: LBP Launch (Week 1-2) — *DUTCH AUCTION OPPORTUNITY*

**Your Window:** 72 hours of price discovery

**What Happens (Dutch Auction):**
- Pool launches with 90% XOM / 10% USDC weighting
- XOM price starts HIGH due to weight imbalance—discourages bots
- Weights shift over 72 hours to 30% XOM / 70% USDC
- Base price DECREASES as weight shifts—creating buying opportunities
- When buyers enter, their purchases push price back up
- Equilibrium forms where declining weight meets rising demand

**Your Strategy:**
- **Don't FOMO at launch**—prices are artificially inflated
- Monitor price decline during weight shift
- Enter when price reaches YOUR target value
- Don't wait too long—buy pressure from others will stabilize/increase price
- Sweet spot is typically mid-LBP (24-48 hours in)

**Parameters:**
- XOM Allocation: 50,000,000 XOM (from treasury)
- Target USDC Participation: $500,000 - $2,000,000
- Starting Price: ~$0.05+ (artificially high from 90% weight)
- Target Equilibrium: $0.005 - $0.010 (where demand meets supply)

### Phase 2: Bonding Program (Week 2-4) — *GUARANTEED DISCOUNTS*

**Your Window:** 30 days of intensive bonding

**What Happens:**
- Bonding opens with 5% discount
- Discounts may increase to 10% based on demand
- Daily capacity limits create urgency

**Your Strategy:**
- Bond early while capacity is available
- Consider bonding LP tokens from LBP for compound returns
- Plan multiple bonds across the 30-day window

**Parameters:**
- Discount: 5% (potentially increasing to 10%)
- Vesting: 7 days
- Daily Capacity: 100,000 XOM (limited)

### Phase 3: Mining Rewards (Week 3 Onward) — *PASSIVE INCOME*

**Your Window:** Ongoing—but early APY is highest

**What Happens:**
- Mining pools open for LP staking
- Early stakers capture highest APY (lower TVL = higher returns)
- Rewards compound as ecosystem grows

**Your Strategy:**
- Stake LP tokens immediately when mining opens
- Claim and compound 30% immediate rewards
- Hold vested rewards for long-term appreciation

**Parameters:**
- Daily Rewards: 50,000 XOM
- Immediate: 30%
- Vested: 70% over 90 days

## Part 4: The Numbers — Your Investment Analysis

### 4.1 What You're Investing In

**Total Ecosystem Liquidity Target:** $8-12 million

Your participation helps build:
- Deep DEX trading liquidity
- RWA pool depth
- Protocol-owned permanent liquidity
- Cross-chain bridge reserves

### 4.2 Treasury Resources Backing Your Investment

**2.5 Billion XOM Treasury Reserve**

This reserve exists to reward YOU. At $0.005/XOM, this represents $12.5 million dedicated to liquidity incentives.

**How Your Rewards Are Funded:**

| Your Reward Source | XOM Allocated | Value for You |
|--------------------|---------------|---------------|
| LBP Participation | 50,000,000 | $250,000 in rewards |
| Bonding Discounts | 100,000,000 | $500,000 in discounts |
| Mining Rewards (Y1) | 18,250,000 | $91,250 in yield |
| Trading Incentives | 15,000,000 | $75,000 in bonuses |
| **Total for Investors** | **183,250,000** | **$916,250** |
| **Remaining Reserve** | **2,316,750,000** | **$11.58M for future** |

**Key Insight:** Only 7.33% of the treasury is allocated for Year 1. The remaining 92.67% ensures long-term program sustainability and potential increased rewards.

### 4.3 Self-Funding Model — Sustainable Returns

Unlike protocols that burn through treasuries, OmniBazaar's model generates more value than it distributes:

**How the Math Works:**

| Flow | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Protocol USDC Commitment | -$460,000 |
| Your LBP USDC (retained as liquidity) | +$1,000,000 |
| Your Bonding Deposits (retained as POL) | +$500,000 |
| **Net Protocol Position** | **+$1,040,000** |

**What This Means for You:**
- Protocol grows stronger with your participation
- Sustainable model = sustainable rewards
- No "death spiral" risk from treasury depletion
- Your liquidity provision directly strengthens your investment

### 4.4 Your Return Scenarios

**Conservative (Bear Market):**

| Strategy | Your Entry | 6-Month Exit | Your Return |
|----------|------------|--------------|-------------|
| LBP | $0.005 (mid-LBP) | $0.005 | +15% (fees) |
| Bonding | 5% discount | Flat price | +26% |
| Mining | 73% APY | Half rewards | +36% |
| **Blended** | | | **+25%** |

**Base Case (Stable Market):**

| Strategy | Your Entry | 6-Month Exit | Your Return |
|----------|------------|--------------|-------------|
| LBP | $0.005 (mid-LBP) | $0.008 | +75% |
| Bonding | 7% discount | +20% price | +67% |
| Mining | 100% APY | Full rewards | +50% |
| **Blended** | | | **+65%** |

**Optimistic (Bull Market):**

| Strategy | Your Entry | 6-Month Exit | Your Return |
|----------|------------|--------------|-------------|
| LBP | $0.004 (well-timed) | $0.015 | +275% |
| Bonding | 10% discount | +100% price | +220% |
| Mining | 150% APY | Token appreciation | +175% |
| **Blended** | | | **+220%** |

## Appendix C: Glossary

**APY (Annual Percentage Yield):** Your annualized return, accounting for compounding. Higher APY = more money in your pocket.

**Bonding:** Trade your assets for discounted XOM with a short vesting period. Guaranteed discount, no impermanent loss.

**Impermanent Loss:** Potential reduction in LP value when token prices diverge. Mitigated by high rewards.

**LBP (Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool):** Fair price discovery mechanism. Early participants typically get best prices.

**LP Token:** Your proof of liquidity provision. Stake these to earn mining rewards.

**Protocol-Owned Liquidity (POL):** Liquidity the protocol owns permanently. Creates price stability that benefits all holders.

**TVL (Total Value Locked):** Total assets in the protocol. Lower TVL = higher APY for you.

**Vesting:** Gradual token release. Aligns incentives and reduces dump risk.
