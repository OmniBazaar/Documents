Use a hardware wallet (Ledger/Trezor) for large amounts\n2. Keep only spending money in hot wallet\n3. Verify all recipient addresses before sending\n4. Double-check website URL (phishing is common)\n5. Keep your device's OS and antivirus updated\n\n**Advanced:**\n1. Use a dedicated device for crypto (old phone/laptop)\n2. Consider multi-sig for very large amounts\n3. Test send with small amount first\n4. Use privacy mode (pXOM) for sensitive transactions\n\n**Red Flags - SCAM ALERTS:**\n❌ Anyone asking for your seed phrase\n❌ \"Support\" asking you to validate your wallet\n❌ Too-good-to-be-true investment opportunities\n❌ Urgent messages requiring immediate action\n\nRemember: Crypto transactions are irreversible.
