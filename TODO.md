# Documentation Module - TODO List

**Last Updated**: 2025-08-30 22:28 UTC  
**Module Status**: COMPLETE - All TypeScript Compilation Issues Resolved

## 🚨 NEW WORKFLOW: Planning Before Coding

### Before Writing ANY Code:
1. **STOP AND PLAN** - Complete the pre-code planning checklist
2. **READ `.claude/pre-code-planning.md`** - Follow ALL requirements
3. **DEFINE TYPES FIRST** - Create all interfaces before implementation
4. **PLAN ERROR HANDLING** - Consider all failure modes
5. **VERIFY MODULE BOUNDARIES** - Check which module you're in

## ✅ Completed Implementation (Phase 1-3)

### Core Systems - ALL COMPLETE
- ✅ **Documentation System** - Full CRUD with multi-language support
- ✅ **Forum System** - P2P forum with consensus moderation
- ✅ **Support System** - Volunteer support with intelligent routing
